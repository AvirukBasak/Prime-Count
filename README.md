# Prime Count

Find of number of integers present for every prime number.

Such is achieved by counting number of integers till a prime number is found.
If the prime number is found, the value is stored in the file `plot_data.txt` and the counter is reset.

A graphical representation of the data will be able to tell us if prime numbers get rarer as we move towards larger integers.

This can be used to gai understanding into the idea `There could be an infinite number of prime numbers`.
